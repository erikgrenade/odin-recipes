    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> There's nothing we love more than a great artisan pizza, with the perfect supple charred crust and gooey toppings. But of course, there’s not time for that every day. Here’s a great shortcut to pizza night: Pita Pizzas!
</p>
<p>
    This recipe uses pita bread to stand in as the crust of a personal pizza. It's the trick to a quick and easy meal, and it’s especially a hit with kids. Not sure what’s for dinner? Try this recipe: it’s faster than delivery pizza!
