    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This pozole is meant to be a little spicy, but adjust the heat to your liking by adding more or less of the chile puree. We call for 3 different types of dried chiles here to round out the soup's complexity with each variety's distinctive characteristics: some are smokier, some have more fire in them, and every type adds a layer of savory fragrance. To make sure you are extracting more flavor and less spice, take the extra time to pull out the membrane and seeds inside each chile before soaking.
</p>
<p>
    The toppings are there to counteract the heat and provide a crunch of freshness in each bite. Sweet cabbage and juicy radish will help cool things off a bit, and if you'd like a pop of green, herbs are always a good idea.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lb. pork shoulder</li>
        <li>6 dried chiles </li>
        <li>3 (15-oz.) cans hominy</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>

        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season pork with salt and pepper. In a large pot over medium heat, add pork, onion, garlic, cloves, cumin seeds, bay leaf, and broth. Add enough water to cover pork by 2”. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Let simmer 1 ½ hours, skimming foam off top as necessary.  </li>
        <li>Place dried chiles into a medium bowl and pour 2 cups boiling water over. Let soak 30 minutes. Place chiles and about ½ cup of their soaking liquid into a blender. Blend until smooth, adding more water as necessary. </li>
        <li>Add chile puree and hominy to pot with pork. Continue to simmer, covered, until pork is very tender, 1 hour and 30 minutes more. </li>
